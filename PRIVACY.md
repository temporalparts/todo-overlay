# Privacy Policy for TABULA Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: August 20, 2025**

## Overview

TABULA ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our data practices for the TABULA Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**TABULA does NOT collect any personal information or user data.**

We do not:
- Track your browsing history
- Collect personal information
- Monitor your task content
- Use analytics or telemetry
- Send data to external servers
- Share information with third parties

## Data Storage

### What We Store
TABULA stores the following data locally on your device:
- Your task list (titles, completion status, priorities, due dates)
- Extension settings (theme preference, snooze duration, dismiss duration)
- Configured domain list (websites where TABULA should appear)
- UI preferences (dark/light mode, quote rotation settings)

### Where We Store It
All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data:
- Never leaves your browser
- Is not accessible to us or any third party
- Can be exported by you at any time
- Is automatically removed if you uninstall the extension

## Permissions Usage

### activeTab
Used only when you click the extension icon to manually activate TABULA on the current page.

### Host Permissions (<all_urls>)
Required to detect when you visit configured websites and display the overlay. We do not track or record your browsing activity.

### Scripting
Used to inject the TABULA interface into web pages. The injected code only creates the task overlay and does not read or modify website content.

### Storage

## Data Security

Your data security is ensured by:
- All data remaining local to your device
