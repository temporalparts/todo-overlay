## Build Requirements

When making changes to the extension code, you must compile the repository:

```bash
cd extension
npm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript and bundles the extension into the `extension/dist` folder.

## Project Structure

- `/extension` - Main Chrome extension source code
- `/extension/src` - TypeScript source files
- `/extension/dist` - Compiled output (generated by build)

## Key Commands

- `npm run build` - Build the extension
- `npm run dev` - Development mode with hot reload
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
