# NudgeNotes

A Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by overlaying a TODO list on distracting websites.

## Getting Started

All extension code is in the `extension` folder:

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
```

Then load the `extension/dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

For detailed instructions, see [extension/README.md](extension/README.md).
