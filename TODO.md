## ‚ùå Deprecated/Not Planned

These features were considered but decided against to maintain focus:

- ~~Project management features~~ - Keep it simple, not another Jira
- ~~Time tracking~~ - Adds complexity without core value
- ~~Social features~~ - This is a personal productivity tool
- ~~Ads or monetization tracking~~ - Privacy first, always
- ~~Cloud storage requirement~~ - Local-first is a core principle

## üìä Implementation Priorities

### Decision Criteria
1. **User Impact** - How many users will benefit?
2. **Complexity** - How difficult to implement?
3. **Core Value** - Does it enhance the distraction-blocking loop?
4. **Privacy** - Does it maintain local-first principles?

### Recommended Order
1. **Tags & Search** - High impact, moderate complexity
2. **Markdown Support** - Highly requested, straightforward
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Power user essential
4. **Recurring Tasks** - Common use case
5. **Obsidian Integration** - Strong user overlap
6. **Analytics** - Helps users understand habits
7. **Mobile App** - Major expansion but different platform

## üí° Design Principles

### Keep the Core Loop Sacred
- The interruption is the feature
- Quick task capture (< 5 seconds)
- Minimal clicks to productivity
- Don't make dismissal too easy

### Privacy is Non-Negotiable
- Local-first always
- Optional cloud features only
- No tracking or analytics to third parties
- User owns their data

### Simplicity Over Features
- Every feature must justify its complexity
- Avoid feature creep
- Stay focused on time reclamation
- Clean, distraction-free UI

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these to guide development:
- Task completion rate
- Time to first productive action after intercept
- Snooze frequency reduction over time
- User retention after 30 days
- Feature adoption rates
